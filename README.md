Tweet To Picture

Twwet to picture is a an app that is a test case for an upcoming project.
This app will convert the tweet into snapshot, all you need to do is to provide the tweet Id.
This is useful when you tweet and want to share the same tweet(which looks same like a tweet) to any other platform.

Many infuncers currently take a screenshot and spend extra time to crop it before uploading. This saves time in the same senario.
Current version is very basic, adding more to it.
