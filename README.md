Tweet To Picture

Tweet to picture is an app that is a test case for an upcoming project.
This app will convert the tweet into a snapshot, all you need to do is to provide the tweet Id.
This is useful when you tweet and want to share the same tweet(which looks the same as a tweet too) on any other platform.

Many influencers currently take a screenshot and spend extra time to crop them before uploading. This saves time in the same scenario.
The current version is very basic, adding more to it.
